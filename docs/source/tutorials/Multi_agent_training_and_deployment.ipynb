    "# MARL training and deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook provides an introduction to training several RL agents with the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm. We use CommonPower to create a simulation of a power system, within which one node (corresponding to a multi-family household) is controlled by the RL agent. Since RL does not naturally allow considering constraints, such as a minimum state of charge of a battery, we have implemented a safety layer that is wrapped around the RL agent. It extracts all necessary constraints from the power system model and checks whether a control action suggested by the agent is safe. If necessary, the safety layer adjust the action, before passing it on to the simulation. The agent then receives a feedback informing it about the adjustment of its action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this notebook, you will learn how to \n",
    "- use CommonPower to import a network topology from pandapower\n",
    "- add components like energy storage systems to such a network\n",
    "- set up a decentralized control scheme with multiple RL agents,\n",
    "- assign nodes to these agents, \n",
    "- train the RL agents, and\n",
    "- monitor the training process using Tensorboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before getting started\n",
    "1. Make sure you install all necessary requirements following the `Readme.txt`\n",
    "2. Optional (only if you want to experiment with tracking training using Weights&Biases): Sign up for the academic version of Weights&Biases [here](https://wandb.ai/site/research).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important ressources for further information\n",
    "### Short introduction to RL\n",
    "If you have never worked with RL before, we recommend reading the [OpenAI Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) introduction of RL.\n",
    "### MAPPO implementation\n",
    "We use a fork of the MAPPO algorithm from the [on-policy repository](https://github.com/TUMcps/on-policy).\n",
    "### Tensorboard\n",
    "[Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started) can be used to track training of any kind of network.\n",
    "### Weights&Biases\n",
    "Weights&Biases (W&B) is an alternative to Tensorboard with very nice visualizations and some advanced options. It helps you keep an overview of your experiments and compare different hyperparameter settings. Find more information in their [documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart)"
